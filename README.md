Hi, my name is Shai Greenblatt, a fullstack developer.
This project is a project aimed at making links shorter.
In this project, you enter your link and receive in return a shortened link to your link, including information about it, for example: the number of hits to your link, from which devices the hits were made, etc.
This project was developed in Node.Js and .Net languages
